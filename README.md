### Password Generator
<a name="desc"></a>
## 1. Description

A password generator web application was created using pre-built HTML and CSS. For this assignment, we wrote the javascript behind the application for it to function.

If the user opens the web application page, and clicks "Generate Password", the user will then receieve a prompt to enter a number between 8 and 128. If a number is chosen outside of those parameters, or a letter is chosen, the user will receive an alert that those choices are not valid and they will have to start over.

After the users selects a number allowed within the defined paramters, they will receive four additional prompts: one to include uppercase letters, one to include lowercase letters, one to include special characters, and one to include numbers.

If the user clicks "Cancel" to the four additional prompts, an alert will show telling the user they need to click at least one of the promps, and then will bring them back to the first of the additional four prompts.

Finally, the password will appear within the text box, and the user can then copy this password to the clipboard.
